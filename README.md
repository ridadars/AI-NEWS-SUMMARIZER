# 📰 AI News Summarizer & Q&A Tool

A simple and beginner-friendly Python tool that:
- Summarizes any news article in **3–4 clear sentences**
- Lets you ask **at least 3 questions** about the article
- Tests how summaries change at **different creativity levels (temperature 0.1 / 0.7 / 1.0)**
- Logs your results and analysis for your assignment

This project was built as part of **Week 4 of the AI Fellowship**, using the [Gemini API](https://aistudio.google.com/) by [Google](https://about.google/).

## ✨ What It Does
This tool makes it easier to work with long articles.  
You give it an article (by pasting it or using a `.txt` file), and it:

1. Shows the **original article length** in words and characters  
2. Creates a **3–4 sentence summary**  
3. Lets you **ask questions** about the article content  
4. Generates **multiple summaries at different temperatures (0.1 = robotic, 1.0 = creative)**  
5. Helps you **record your observations** and complete your assignment write-up

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed:
```bash
python --version
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

This keeps your project clean and separate.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your Gemini API Key

* Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
* Create a file called `.env` in the project folder with this inside:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use

### Option 1 — Use a `.txt` File (recommended)

Paste your article into `article.txt` and run:

```bash
python summarizer.py --file article.txt --experiment-temps "0.1,0.7,1.0" --qa
```

### Option 2 — Paste Text in Terminal

```bash
python summarizer.py --stdin --experiment-temps "0.1,0.7,1.0" --qa
```

### Option 3 — Use a URL (if allowed)

```bash
python summarizer.py --url "https://example.com/article" --experiment-temps "0.1,0.7,1.0" --qa
```

> ⚠️ Many sites block scraping. If you get a `403` or `401` error, copy the article into `article.txt` instead.

---

## 💬 Asking Questions (Q\&A)

After summarization, the script will ask you to enter questions like:

```
Q1: Who performed at Wembley Stadium?
Q2: How many people attended their tour?
Q3: What was unique about their concert?
```

Each question is answered using **only** the article text.

---

## 📊 Temperature Experiments

You can test how creativity affects summaries:

* **0.1 → Robotic, factual**
* **0.7 → Balanced and clear**
* **1.0 → More creative and free**

All outputs are saved into `runs/`, and you can paste them into `observations.md` to write your comparison.

---

## 📌 .gitignore (important!)

Make sure these are inside your `.gitignore` so they don’t get uploaded:

```
.env
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
runs/*.json
```

---

## 📎 Notes

* This project is designed for **learning how to use LLMs (Large Language Models)** in real-world tasks.
* It’s intentionally beginner-friendly — you only need basic Python to run it.
* All work stays local on your machine.
