# 📰 AI News Summarizer & Q&A Tool

A beginner-friendly Python tool that:

- Summarizes any news article in 3–4 clear sentences
- Lets you ask at least 3 questions about the article
- Tests how summaries change at different creativity levels (temperature 0.1 / 0.7 / 1.0)
- Logs your results and analysis for your assignment
- Built as part of Week 4 of the AI Fellowship, using the Gemini API by Google

## ✨ Features

- *Input any article* (paste text, use a .txt file, or URL if supported)
- *Shows original article length* (words + characters)
- *Generates a concise summary* (3–4 sentences)
- *Allows interactive Q&A* based only on the article
- *Creates multiple summaries* at different temperatures:
  - 0.1 → Robotic & factual
  - 0.7 → Balanced & clear
  - 1.0 → More creative & free
- *Saves all outputs* in the runs/ folder for analysis
- *Helps you complete* observations.md for your assignment write-up

```


⚠ *Important*: .env must not be pushed to GitHub. Add it to .gitignore.

## ⚙ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed:

bash
python --version


### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate


### 3. Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 4. Add Your Gemini API Key
1. Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
2. Create a .env file in the project root with:

env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


## ▶ How to Use

### Option 1 — From a .txt File (Recommended)
Paste your article into article.txt and run:

bash
python summarizer.py --file article.txt --experiment-temps "0.1,0.7,1.0" --qa


### Option 2 — Paste Text in Terminal

bash
python summarizer.py --stdin --experiment-temps "0.1,0.7,1.0" --qa


### Option 3 — From a URL (if supported)

bash
python summarizer.py --url "https://example.com/article" --experiment-temps "0.1,0.7,1.0" --qa


⚠ *Note*: Many sites block scraping. If you see 403 or 401 errors, copy the article into article.txt instead.

## 💬 Asking Questions (Q&A)

After summarization, the script will ask you to enter questions. Example:


Q1: Who performed at Wembley Stadium?
Q2: How many people attended their tour?
Q3: What was unique about their concert?


The tool answers using only the article text.

## 📊 Temperature Experiments

You can compare how summaries change at different temperatures:

- *0.1* → Robotic, factual
- *0.7* → Balanced, natural
- *1.0* → Creative, free-flowing

All results are auto-saved into runs/ and can be copied into observations.md for your analysis.

## 📌 .gitignore

Make sure your .gitignore includes:

gitignore
.env
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
runs/*.json
